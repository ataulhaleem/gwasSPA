        <h3>Assessment of population stratification (Principal Component Analysis)</h3>
        <p>Population stratification refers to differences in allele frequencies between cases and controls that are due to
         systematic differences in ancestry rather than association of genes with disease. It has been suggested that 
         false-positive associations due to stratification can be controlled by genotyping a few dozen unrelated genetic markers.</p>
